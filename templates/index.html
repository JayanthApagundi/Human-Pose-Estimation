      <h1> Human Pose Estimation </h1>
      <p class="col-md-6 pt-5 pr-4">Human Pose Estimation is defined as the problem of localization of human joints (also known as keypoints - elbows, wrists, etc) in images or videos. It is also defined as the search for a specific pose in space of all articulated poses. 2D Pose estimates a 2D pose (x,y) coordinates for each joint from a RGB image. 3D Pose estimates a 3D pose (x,y,z) coordinates a RGB image.
      Human Pose Estimation has some pretty cool applications like surveillance and security, Augmented/Virtual Reality, Animations, Gaming, Activity recognition, Teaching robots to perform particular action/tasks </p>
